# Random Room Scene

This project creates a 3D scene of a room with random placement of interior objects using Three.js. Users can explore the room using mouse controls.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that includes the Three.js library and links to the JavaScript file.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that sets up the Three.js scene, creates the room, and randomly places objects within it.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need a modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository or download the files:**

    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

    Alternatively, you can download the files directly and unzip them.

2. **Ensure you have the following files in your project directory:**

    - `index.html`
    - `script.js`

### Running the Project

1. **Open `index.html` in a web browser:**

    You can simply double-click on the `index.html` file, or open it from within your browser.

    ```sh
    open index.html
    ```

    This will load the HTML file and execute the JavaScript, creating a 3D scene of a room with randomly placed objects.

## Files Description

### `index.html`

The HTML file sets up the basic structure of the webpage. It includes the Three.js library and links to the `script.js` file.

### `script.js`

The JavaScript file creates the Three.js scene, sets up the camera and renderer, adds a room with randomly placed objects, and implements controls for exploring the room with the mouse.
